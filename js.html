          JavaScript, or JS for short, is a scripting language commonly associated with providing interactivity in HTML pages.
          ///
          ///
          It's typically used for interacting with the DOM (Document Object Model), or simply the elements on an HTML page. It is a weakly typed, dynamic language which leads it to be fairly easy to pick up. These do come at the cost of performance however.
        </div>
        <h3 id='getelementbyid' class='format'>getElementById method</h3>
        <div class='format'>
          In JavaScript, to interact, edit, store and retrieve data from elements, you need to first get a reference to the element. This can be done in many ways, but one is to call `document.getElementById()`.
          ///
          You pass the name of the element's ID (without the `#`), and it returns a reference to the element which you can store.
```var mainDiv = document.getElementById('main-content');```
        </div>
        <h3 id='innerhtml' class='format'>innerHTML method</h3>
        <div class='format'>
          To change the content of whats inside an element, one method is to use the `innerHTML` attribute to set it to something new. This is a very bad idea, and in most cases you should avoid using this as it causes the entire page to re-calculate all the graphics.
          ///
          ///
          If you wanted to add a `p` tag inside a div with ID `main-content`, you could do so:
```var mainDiv = document.getElementById('main-content');

mainDiv.innerHTML += '<\p>Here is my paragraph of text<\/p>';```
        </div>
        <h3 id='write' class='format'>write method</h3>
        <div class='format'>
          Another method to set content inside an element is to use the `write()` method. This overwrites any existing data, and so is very *very* rarely used anywhere except for testing.
```var mainDiv = document.getElementById('main-content');

mainDiv.write('<\p>Here is my paragraph of text<\/p>');```
        </div>
        <h3 id='alert' class='format'>alert function</h3>
        <div class='format'>
          The `alert()` function is something a little different to our previous examples. It doesn't change or manipulate elements in any way, rather it send a popup message to the user with some information.
          ///
          ///
          You could for example let the user know that a file has finished downloading, or that an error has occured.
```alert('This is the text that will appear in the popup');```
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
